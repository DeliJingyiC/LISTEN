# Website Fixed! âœ…

## What Was Wrong

The changes were being made to `/LISTEN-website/` (the new separate repo), but your GitHub Pages was still serving from `/LISTEN/docs/` (the old location).

## What I Did

1. **Copied all updated files** from `LISTEN-website/` to `LISTEN/docs/`:
   - `index.html` (with word-flipping animation)
   - `styles.css` (with new color scheme)
   - `game.html` (interactive challenge)
   - `script.js` (leaderboard)
   - All images and PDFs

2. **Pushed to GitHub**: All changes are now live at `https://delijingyic.github.io/LISTEN/`

## Changes Now Live

### âœ… 1. New Color Scheme (Professional & Clean)
- **Hero background**: Cream (#faf8f5) instead of blue-purple gradient
- **Text**: Navy (#1a1f36) instead of white
- **Sections**: Clean with subtle borders
- **Overall**: Warm, research-focused aesthetic (like Thinking Machines Lab)

### âœ… 2. Word-Flipping Animation
The hero title now animates:
```
"Do Audio LLMs LISTEN?"
         â†“ (2 seconds)
"Do Audio LLMs Transcribe?"
         â†“ (2 seconds)
"Do Audio LLMs LISTEN?"
```

### âœ… 3. Featured Game Section
Added between Overview and Leaderboard:
- Navy background (creates visual contrast)
- "Can You Beat the AI?" heading
- 3 stats: 5 Challenges, 3 AI Models, 2min Duration
- Interactive preview showing conflict
- "Take the Challenge" CTA button

### âœ… 4. Navigation Update
- Button renamed: "ðŸ§  Human vs. AI Challenge"
- Minimalist navy styling with border hover
- Glass-morphism effect on navbar

### âœ… 5. Button Redesign
- All buttons: Navy with white text
- Hover: Transparent with navy border
- No more gradients (cleaner, more professional)

## Verify Changes

Visit: **https://delijingyic.github.io/LISTEN/**

You should now see:
1. Cream hero section with navy text
2. "LISTEN/Transcribe" words flipping every 2 seconds
3. Navy featured game section after overview
4. Clean, minimalist button styles throughout
5. "Human vs. AI Challenge" in navigation

**Note**: GitHub Pages may take 2-3 minutes to rebuild. Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R) if you still see the old version.

## Two Repository Setup

You now have:

1. **LISTEN/** (public repo at github.com/DeliJingyiC/LISTEN)
   - Contains: Code + Website in `docs/`
   - This is what GitHub Pages serves
   - âœ… **Updated with new design**

2. **LISTEN-website/** (local, not yet pushed to private repo)
   - Contains: Website files only
   - For future: separate private repo
   - Currently just a backup/working directory

## Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to separate the website into a private repo later:
1. Create private repo on GitHub
2. Push `LISTEN-website/` contents
3. Remove `LISTEN/docs/` from public repo
4. Point GitHub Pages to the private repo

But for now, **everything is working from the public repo's docs folder**! ðŸŽ‰
